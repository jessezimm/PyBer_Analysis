# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to understand ride, driver, and fare statistics based on city type. This information can help the CEO determine where to allocate resources such as drivers and what amount to charge by city.

## Results
The total rides, drivers, and fares is especially larger in Urban as opposed to Rural and Suburban cities. However, the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver are highest in Rural cities. This is likely a supply and demand phenomena. The supply of drivers is less in Rural cities, and therefore, these drivers can charge more.
