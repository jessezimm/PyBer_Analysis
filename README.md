# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to understand ride, driver, and fare statistics based on city type. This information can help the CEO determine where to allocate resources such as drivers and what amount to charge by city.

## Results
The total rides, drivers, and fares is especially larger in Urban as opposed to Rural and Suburban cities. However, the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver are highest in Rural cities. This is likely a supply and demand phenomena. The supply of drivers is less in Rural cities, and therefore, these drivers can charge more.

The graph displays the total fare from January to April of 2019 by city type. Urban cities had total fares around $2000 for these months while Suburban cities had $1000 and Rural cities had $250. Evidently, there is more demand for drivers in Urban as opposed to Rural cities.

## Analysis
The CEO should allocate more drivers to Urban cities and charge more in fares in Rural cities. Suburban cities should be monitored for special events that may increase demand, but for now, keep the number of drivers and average fares in between that of Rural and Urban cities.
